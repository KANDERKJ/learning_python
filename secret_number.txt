The goal of is to create a simple text based game

THE RULES:

I) Generate a random number within the range of 1-100. How to generate random numbers?

>>> import random
>>> random.randint(1, 100)
90

II) Prompt the user to guess a number between 1-100
Remember, use input() function to read in input, and int() to convert input to int

III) Give the user feedback on their guess.
    i) If user guess is larger than secret number then print 'NUM is larger than secret number.'
       Replace NUM with the user's guess
    ii) If user guess is less than secret number then print 'NUM is less than secret number.'
        Replace NUM with user's guess
    iii) If NUM is equal to the secret number then print two statements: 
         i) 'NUM is the secret number', where NUM is the secret number
         ii) Print 'You win!'
            i) Terminate the gameplay
 IV) User should be given a chance to play the game indefinitely until they guess the correct number
